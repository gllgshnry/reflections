1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you collaborate with others on a single project. This way your work is 
shared instead of being kept private on your local working directory.


2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than havnig Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

By manually pulling the changes you can ensure that the changes are something
you want to incorporate, so that it does not break your project. Even though
GitHub commits are usually more thoroughly inspected they may contain something
undesirable to you, especially when you did not create the GitHub commit you
will be pulling. Automatic pulls will change your repository any time a new 
commit is pushed by someone, and may result in omitting your current local work
