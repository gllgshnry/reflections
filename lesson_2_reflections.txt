1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a repository creates a .git file, which contains the metadata for
the repository. Initialization does not commit any of the files, meaning that
there are no files being tracked as of the creation of the repository. 
git status will inform you of what is present in the directory/repository, yet
untracked. 


2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area only contains files that you want tracked, where the working
directory contains all the files in it. This allows the user to commit only the
files that have had a logical change, or that need to be tracked together.
